#Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project for sentiment analysis of movie reviews. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.

The main components of this repository are as follows:

Dataset: The movie_reviews.csv file contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. It is a CSV file, with each row representing a movie review and its corresponding sentiment label (positive or negative).


Model: The trained machine learning model is saved as sentiment_analysis_model.pkl. This model can be loaded and used for making predictions on new movie reviews.

Requirements: The requirements.txt file lists the Python libraries and their versions required to run the code successfully. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
